Once in this mode, simply left-click to select a face, (use the standard shift-left-click to select multiple), and manipulate them with with the standard unity movement handles. </span><span class="c8 c15">To toggle into Vertex Geometry Editing, hit the &ldquo;H&rdquo; key on your keyboard.</span></p><p class="c17 c7 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c7 c17"><img height="40" src="images/image17.png" width="40"><span>Vertex Geometry Editing gives you even finer control, right down to the individual vertices. Since showing all the vertices in a complex scene could very likely crash Unity, you must select any ProBuilder Objects whose vertices you intend to edit. Their vertices will immediately show up as blue dots, and can then be selected (their color will change to green) and manipulated. You can drag-select vertices, and use the &ldquo;Shift&rdquo; key to add to the selection, just like any other item in Unity. </span><span class="c9">ProTip- click on a face to instantly select all of it&rsquo;s connected vertices!</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c15">To toggle into Face Geometry Editing, hit the &ldquo;H&rdquo; key on your keyboard.</span></p><p class="c17 c7 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><img height="40" src="images/image14.png" width="40"><span>Texture Editing mode opens the Texture and UV Tools panel, giving you access to the powerful uv and texturing toolset of ProBuilder.

ACGs have the advantage of staying separate objects in the editor, but auto-merging in the game. However, at the time of writing this, they can sometimes result in slightly more draw calls than Merging in the editor, since lightmapping does not always keep all objects in the ACG on the same sheet. This will be fixed in an upcoming release!</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><img height="42" src="images/image00.png" width="42"><span class="c2">Create ProBuilder Group:</span><span>&nbsp;This button will parent all selected ProBuilder objects to a new, empty game object.

Before you jump right in though, you should definitely watch the ProBuilder &ldquo;Intro to Modeling&rdquo; tutorial- it&rsquo;s fairly quick but extremely informative. Here, we&rsquo;ll go over some basic tips, tricks, and advice for modeling with ProBuilder 2.0:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Use ProGrids!</span><span>&nbsp;If you are not using ProGrids, at least the free version, you are seriously handicapping yourself. With ProBuilder, you will most often be constructing hard-surface models, with many parts that need to align exactly, match sizes, and so forth. ProGrids will save you hours of time and sanity, and your resulting creation will look and function better as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stay &ldquo;On The Grid&rdquo;. </span><span>Now that you are using ProGrids, stay on that grid! Making sure all your vertices are on an exact grid point will make your ProBuilder objects much, much simpler to align, edit, and modify.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Start Big. </span><span>The first version you build won&rsquo;t always be wrong, but it won&rsquo;t ever be right, either. So, start with with large, simple, boxy construction- I typically start at a grid level of 50cm, sometimes 25 if I&rsquo;m feeling extra confident in the design. If you are building a level or world, test out the flow, fit, and scale. Even do some lighting and atmosphere tests, really get a feel for what you are constructing. Then pair it down to smaller and smaller grid levels, adding more detail with each level, just like LODs.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stick to 45 Degree Angles</span><span>.

In the case of ProBuilder, just know this- nothing special at all is happening with materials or textures. You apply materials to your ProBuilder objects just like any other object, and those materials will act/display just the same, as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>That aside, there are several ways to apply materials in ProBuilder. </span><span>All of the following methods assume you are already in Texture Edit mode, and have a material set in the Material Slot of the Texture and UV Tools panel:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Apply To Entire Object(s): </span><span>To apply one material to an entire object, or several objects, first select the full object(s) by either drag-selecting a box, or selecting via the Hierarchy. Click the &ldquo;Apply Material&rdquo; button to instantly paint all faces of the selected object(s) with the chosen material.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Apply to Selected Face(s): </span><span>Select one or more faces, then click the &ldquo;Apply Material&rdquo; button to instantly paint all selected faces with the chosen material.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Quick Paint: </span><span>This one is very handy! While holding ctrl and shift on the keyboard, any face you left-click on will be instantly be painted with the chosen material.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c15">[7-c] Editing UVs</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Being able to edit the individual UVs of each face on a ProBuilder Object, allows for virtually infinite variation and re-use of textures. This is great for both performance and making your scene look great!</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>For example, use the </span><span class="c2">Flip and Swap U/V</span><span>&nbsp;toggles to quickly make three different faces look different, despite using the same material. These are also handy if your texture needs to have a specific direction (arrows, grids, text, etc).</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Use </span><span class="c2">Offset</span><span>&nbsp;to move textures around, displaying only certain parts of the texture per-face, or in an exact location. You can even use the movement handles for quick, intuitive control of placement.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Scale</span><span>, or &ldquo;tiling&rdquo;, is extremely handy for controlling the perceived size of an item, fitting textures to geometry, and lessening obviously tiling patterns.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The </span><span class="c2">Fill Mode</span><span>&nbsp;options allow you control over the basic method of UV mapping that is applied to the selected face(s):</span></p><ol class="c0" start="1"><li class="c10 c7"><span>Tile: Default behavior, this simply tiles the the UVs uniformly. Useful in 95% of cases, ie wooden floors, plaster walls, ground, etc</span></li><li class="c10 c7"><span>Normalize: This will fill the face completely, without any tiling, but keep the UVs square, so no stretching or squashing occurs. This generally means the texture will be cropped on one of it&rsquo;s sides.</span></li><li class="c10 c7"><span>Stretch: The same as Normalize, however this mode will stretch or squash the UVs so that the entire texture is shown on the face.</span></li></ol><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>U</span><span class="c2">V Justify</span><span>&nbsp;can anchor the texture to any of the 4 sides of a face, or to the center. Very useful in situations where you need the texture placement to stay put while you edit geometry.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Projection</span><span>&nbsp;gives you advanced control over exactly how the texture is &ldquo;projected&rdquo; onto the surface. 99% of the time you will want to just leave this on Auto, however the option is available just for those special, niche situations where nothing else will work, and such control is needed.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><hr><p class="c7 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c7 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6">[8]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VisGroups and Entity Types</span></p><p class="c7 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>All ProBuilder objects have an Entity Type, or simply &ldquo;type&rdquo;. These are basically categories, like &ldquo;Melee, Ranged, Explosive, etc&rdquo;- they set certain properties in the object, and how it acts in your game.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>VisGroups are simply a very handy side effect of these Entity Types. Since all ProBuilder objects have a type, and you generally don&rsquo;t need to see all types at once, you can use the VisGroups panel to toggle the visibility on or off for each &ldquo;group&rdquo; of types. This becomes extremely useful as your scenes become more and more detailed/complex.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Detail </span><span>is the standard, default ProBuilder Object type. A mesh with a texture and a collider, nothing more. It can be occluded, but </span><span class="c5">will </span><span class="c5 c2">not</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;occlude other objects</span><span>. This is set as default, since too many occluders will actually hurt performance much more than too few. </span><span class="c8">Set any ProBuilder object(s) to &ldquo;Detail&rdquo; type by selecting them, and hitting the &ldquo;B&rdquo; key on your keyboard. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">World</span><span>&nbsp;type objects are same as Detail, except they </span><span class="c5 c2">do</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;oc</span><span class="c5">cl</span><span class="c5">ude other objects</span><span>. If you have large, simple objects, ones that you know will block larger portions of your level from view, they should probably be set as &ldquo;World&rdquo; type. </span><span class="c8">Set any ProBuilder object(s) to &ldquo;World&rdquo; type by selecting them, and hitting the &ldquo;O&rdquo; key on your keyboard.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Collision </span><span>objects are invisible in-game, but still have full collision. These are very handy for smoothing stairways into ramps, adding player clip to round out sharp corners, force fields, and many other semi-advanced uses. They will show in the editor as bright-green and semi transparent. Naturally, they do not occlude or block light. However, you should always disable them via VisGroups panel before lightmapping, or their color will affect nearby areas. </span><span class="c8">Set any ProBuilder object(s) to &ldquo;Collision&rdquo; type by selecting them, and hitting the &ldquo;C&rdquo; key on your keyboard.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Triggers</span><span>&nbsp;are a special type of ProBuilder object, designed specifically to aid in the creation of Zones, Volumes, and (of course) Triggers. They are invisible in game, but have a collision component set to &ldquo;trigger&rdquo;. This makes them great for things like triggering elevators, doors, or cutscenes (as the player enters or exits the Trigger zone), designating &ldquo;Kill Zones&rdquo; or FX Volumes, and so forth. </span><span class="c8">Set any ProBuilder object(s) to &ldquo;Trigger&rdquo; type by selecting them, and hitting the &ldquo;T&rdquo; key on your keyboard.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">NoDraw</span><span>&nbsp;is actually not an Entity Type, but does have a VisGroup dedicated to it. &ldquo;NoDraw&rdquo; refers to any ProBuilder Object&rsquo;s face that has the NoDraw material applied to it. Toggling on/off the NoDraw VisGroup will show/hide all faces (not the entire object) that have NoDraw applied. </span><span class="c9">You should be using NoDraw a lot, so be sure to read the &ldquo;Optimization&rdquo; section below for details on it&rsquo;s use and methods!</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c9"></span></p><hr><p class="c7 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6">[9]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Optimization</span></p><p class="c7 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>ProBuilder 2.0 is very efficient on it&rsquo;s own- in fact it is 6x more efficient than ProBuilder 1.x without any work on your part, due to using a single mesh per object now. On top of that, we have expanded the already existing optimization methods, and added a few new ones- all of which are simple to implement, and will seriously aid your project.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">NoDraw</span><span>&nbsp;will be your primary method of optimization. Any face that will never be seen in-game, should always be set as &ldquo;NoDraw&rdquo;. These faces will be deleted at runtime, which makes a substantial dent in the number of vertices being rendered. Most importantly, NoDraw faces are not lightmapped, which saves you quite a bit of texture space, and saves you time when baking lightmaps. Do not underestimate this- if done properly, NoDraw faces will be around 40-60% of your scene!</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Setting a face as NoDraw is quick and simple- simply apply the &ldquo;NoDraw&rdquo; material to it. However, you </span><span class="c2">must </span><span>do this via the Texture and UV Tools panel, not by simply drag-and-dropping the material onto the object.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">While in Texture Edit mode, you can also select any number of faces, and hit &ldquo;N&rdquo; on the keyboard to apply the NoDraw material, without changing your chosen material.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lastly, there is also the &ldquo;Auto NoDraw&rdquo; action available from the top Unity menu, under &ldquo;Window &gt; ProBuilder &gt; Actions &gt; Auto NoDraw&rdquo;. This will automatically apply NoDraw to all faces that appear to be completely occluded, and is a quick way to get all those annoying small/inner/hidden faces. However, be aware that this action is somewhat experimental still, and while it will get all the hidden faces, it often will apply NoDraw to incorrect faces as well. In general though, it&rsquo;s much faster (and more accurate) to use Auto NoDraw, and then fix it&rsquo;s few mistakes, than to hunt down each and every face yourself.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">ProTip- when starting out, build your entire scene in NoDraw, then only apply &ldquo;real&rdquo; materials to those faces you are certain you will see.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Occlusion </span><span>is your second best method of optimization. Wherever you have large, simple ProBuilder objects, assign them the &ldquo;World&rdquo; Entity Type. This will let them take advantage of Unity&rsquo;s Occlusion system, by becoming Occluders. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>However, Occlusion&rsquo;s benefits are very much situational. Too much Occlusion can be worse than too little- the game needs to calculate what can and can&rsquo;t be seen, and if you have a very complex Occlusion setup, it can easily crush your framerate. On the other hand, if you have a room with lots of high-poly objects inside, even a complex Occluder might be worthwhile. Further, if you use purely static Occlusion data, then you can use quite a few more Occluders without hurting performance, and vice versa if using a more dynamic Occlusion method.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Occlusion can be tricky at first, but will yield serious performance benefits, so don&rsquo;t overlook it. </span><span class="c9">Experiment with this one, and read up on Unity&rsquo;s Occlusion system for the best results.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Merging </span><span>allows you to collapse multiple ProBuilder objects into one single object, while still being able to edit it like any other ProBuilder object. This is mainly useful for reducing draw calls. </span><span class="c9">See &ldquo;Merging&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Interface Overview&rdquo; section for details on using this function.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">AutoCollapse Groups </span><span>work the same as Merging, but don&rsquo;t actually merge down to a single object until entering the game. This is useful when you don&rsquo;t want to completely merge objects in the editor, but still need them to merge in-game. </span><span class="c9">See &ldquo;AutoCollapse Groups&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Interface Overview&rdquo; section for details on using this function. </span><span class="c2">NOTE: this feature has been removed temporarily, but will be back soon!</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Custom Collision </span><span>should be used wherever possible, as it can significantly reduce in-game overhead and pre-game loading times. Essentially, anywhere that you can reduce a complex collider, or a group of colliders, down to a single, simple collider, you should use Custom Collision. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>A good example of this is a stairway- if you left it&rsquo;s collision default, each and every step is part of the collision, and it would also be non-convex. Instead, disable the stairway&rsquo;s collision component, then create a ProBuilder Object that matches the stairways slope. Set this Object to the &ldquo;Collision&rdquo; Entity Type by pressing &ldquo;C&rdquo; on your keyboard, and give the stairway a test run- not only will your game run better, but you can now move smoothly up and down the stairway, without those annoying &ldquo;bumping&rdquo; and collision-snagging actions that happen far too often in sub-par games. Here is an image for better illustration:</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><img height="207" src="images/image01.png" width="565"></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Do Not Scale </span><span>ProBuilder Objects! Scaling breaks batching (bad for draw calls), skews UV coordinates, causes havoc with scripting, and (probably) rips the very fabric of the universe. The only thing worse than scaling, is the dreaded Boolean. Please, just trust us on this one! </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lightmap Size </span><span>is a special fix that involves using a separate script, so we left it for last. Essentially, all the visual optimizations in ProBuilder are geared toward reducing draw calls- this is mostly done by getting objects to &ldquo;batch&rdquo; in the renderer. In an ideal game, every single mesh that uses the same material will batch down to one single draw call. You could have thousands of items, and only one draw call- as long as they all batch properly.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Unfortunately, there are lots of things that break batching- scaling, as mentioned is one of those. Another, trickier one, is lightmap index.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Lets say you have 10 objects, you lightmap your scene, and end up with 2 lightmaps at 1024x1024 each. All objects should batch down to one, but you get 2 draw calls- why? Because you have more than one lightmap, and therefore, technically more than one material. This can get really ugly in a real-world situation, where you have multiple materials, and once you lightmap, your objects are spread throughout the lightmaps, allowing only a few or none to actually batch.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">So, the solution is bigger lightmaps. And you can control that via this very handy script:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c11 c9"><a class="c4" href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/56435-light-map-max-at-1k-solved">http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/56435-light-map-max-at-1k-solved</a></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>All credit for this &ldquo;Optimization&rdquo;, and many thanks, goes to the forum users in the above linked post.
